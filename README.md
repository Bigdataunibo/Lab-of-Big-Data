# Install and Import the Essential Libraries

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook related to Big Data and Green Computing.

## Overview

In this notebook, we analyzed a 3-year dataset of operational carbon footprints and applied linear regression and KNN models to predict monthly values. The notebook includes the following key components:

- Installation and import of essential libraries.
- Data preprocessing and visualization.
- Application of Linear Regression and KNN models.
- Evaluation of model performance.
- Discussion on the implications of green computing in the context of big data.
