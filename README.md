# Install and Import the Essential Libraries

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook related to Big Data, Green Computing, and LLMs for Time Series.

## Overview

This notebook demonstrates the implementation and analysis of large language models (LLMs) for time series data within the context of green computing. The notebook includes the following key components:

- Installation and import of essential libraries.
- Data preprocessing and visualization.
- Application of LLMs for time series analysis.
- Evaluation of model performance.
- Discussion on the implications of green computing in the context of big data.
